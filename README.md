- Hardened backend (CORS, rate limits, request timeouts, robust error handling)

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Nodemailer, OpenAI Responses API, PDFKit, ExcelJS
- Frontend: React (CRA), React Router v6, MUI, Axios

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- npm v8+
- MongoDB running locally or a connection string (MongoDB Atlas)
- OpenAI API key
- Gmail App Password (recommended) or generic SMTP credentials

## Setup

### 1) Backend
1. Create a `.env` file in `backend/` based on `backend/example.env`.
2. Install dependencies. `npm install`
3. Start the server in development mode, or run in production. (`npm start`/`npm dev`)

Environment variables (most important):
- MONGODB_URI: Mongo connection string
- JWT_SECRET: any strong random string
- OPENAI_API_KEY: your OpenAI key
- LLM_MODEL: OpenAI model id (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)
- FRONTEND_URL: URL of the frontend (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- Gmail-based email (preferred): GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_PASS (App Password)
- or SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS
- ADMIN_EMAIL/ADMIN_PASSWORD to auto-create an admin at startup

The server defaults to port 5000.

### 2) Frontend
1. Create a `.env` file in `frontend/` (optional). By default, development requests proxy to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Install dependencies. `npm install`
3. Start the dev server (default on http://localhost:3000 - `npm start`). 

`REACT_APP_API_URL` is optional; if set, it should be `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## First Run Walkthrough
1. Ensure MongoDB is running.
2. Start the backend, then the frontend.
3. Register a user, check your mailbox, and verify your email via the link.
4. Log in and upload a syllabus (PDF/DOC/DOCX; up to 10MB by default).
5. The system runs AI analysis in the background; the status will switch to analyzed.
6. Explore:
   - Analysis Overview with template compliance, ILO alignment, plagiarism, clusters & UA cases, survey insights
   - Grouped Recommendations (by categories above)
   - AI Challenger: respond to the initial question, iterate, and finalize to persist concise suggestions
   - Exports: per-syllabus detailed PDF/Excel/CSV; aggregate analytics (manager/admin)

## Roles & Permissions
- instructor: owns their syllabi; can upload, analyze, discuss, export their own
- manager: management analytics and exports
- admin: user management; created automatically if ADMIN_EMAIL/PASSWORD provided

- In Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2‚ÄëStep Verification ‚Üí App passwords
- Create an app password for ‚ÄúMail‚Äù and ‚ÄúOther/Custom‚Äù (e.g., KSE Analyzer)
- Use your Gmail address as GMAIL_USER and the 16‚Äëchar app password as GMAIL_PASS
- Alternatively configure SMTP_* variables; EMAIL_FROM is optional

## OpenAI Setup
- Set OPENAI_API_KEY
- Optionally set LLM_MODEL; recommended small, fast models like `gpt-4o-mini`
- Ukrainian case search uses Responses API with web_search_preview tool (no JSON mode for that call)

## Exports
- Per-syllabus: PDF includes overview, ILO alignment, practicality, grouped recs, AI Challenger summary, and appendix with discussion and recommendations
- Aggregate: CSV/Excel/PDF with core metrics and counts

## Theming and Profile
- Profile: edit first/last name, email (re-verification required), department, avatar URL, change password
- Settings: theme selection (system/light/dark); theme respects system preference when set to system

## Troubleshooting
- 403 at login: account not verified; use ‚Äúresend verification‚Äù
- 503 responses: database temporarily unavailable
- 504 timeouts: long-running requests are cut to avoid hangs; retry or check logs
- CORS: set FRONTEND_URL to your actual frontend origin
- Rate limits: defaults can be tuned via RATE_LIMIT_* env vars

## Security Notes
- JWT secret must be strong and kept private
- Use HTTPS in production
- Do not commit real .env files or secrets

# AI Recommendation Generation Process Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the complete process of how AI recommendations are created in the KSE AI Syllabus Analyzer system. The documentation has been enhanced with comprehensive console logging to help developers understand and modify the recommendation generation process.

## System Architecture

The recommendation system generates four main types of recommendations:
1. **Main Syllabus Analysis** - Comprehensive analysis of uploaded syllabi
2. **Interactive Recommendations** - User-triggered practical teaching ideas
3. **AI Challenger** - Conversational recommendations through instructor-AI dialogue
4. **Ukrainian Cases** - Web-searched relevant business cases

## Input Materials and Sources

### 1. Static Materials (Unchanging)
- **Syllabus Template**: MBA template structure verified by KSE experts
- **MBA-27 Learning Objectives**: Academic standards approved by the program
- **Source**: `initializeStaticContent()` method in AIService constructor

### 2. Dynamic Materials (Updated Regularly)

#### Student Clusters
- **Source**: MongoDB database via `getCurrentStudentClusters()`
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly updates based on real student data
- **Content**: 4 main clusters
  - Technology Leaders
  - Finance/Banking
  - Military/Public
  - Business Ops & Management

#### Survey Insights
- **Source**: Google Forms integration via `getSurveyInsights()`
- **Update Method**: Webhook from Google Forms to Survey/SurveyResponse models
- **Content**:
  - Common work challenges
  - Decision types

### 3. User-Provided Materials
- **Syllabus Text**: Extracted from uploaded PDF/DOCX files
- **Processing**: pdf-parse for PDFs, mammoth for Word documents

## Recommendation Generation Process

### 1. Main Comprehensive Analysis (`performComprehensiveAnalysis`)

**Input Processing:**
```
üìÑ Syllabus text (user upload)
üë• Student clusters (database)
üìä Survey insights (Google Forms)
üìã Static templates and objectives
```

**AI Prompt Construction:**
- Combines all input materials into a structured Ukrainian-language prompt
- Includes specific instructions for JSON output format
- Specifies analysis sections: templateCompliance, learningObjectivesAlignment, studentClusterAnalysis, surveyInsights, structure, recommendations

**AI Processing:**
- Model: Configurable (default: gpt-4o-mini)
- Format: JSON object mode
- Language: Ukrainian for recommendations
- Timing: Typically 2-5 seconds

**Output Processing:**
- JSON parsing with fallback error handling
- Integration with Ukrainian cases from web search
- Normalization to match database schema
- Categorization and prioritization of recommendations

### 2. Interactive Recommendations (`generateInteractiveRecommendations`)

**Trigger**: User requests from frontend for specific topics

**Input:**
```
üìù Topic (user-specified)
üë• Student clusters (from syllabus analysis)
üìä Difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
```

**Process:**
- English-language prompt for practical teaching ideas
- JSON mode for structured output
- Focus on Ukrainian companies and data sources
- Generates 3-5 activity suggestions

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "Case Study",
      "title": "Activity Title",
      "description": "Activity description",
      "relevance": "Why relevant for clusters",
      "potential_sources": "Ukrainian companies/sources"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. AI Challenger Process

#### Start Challenge (`startPracticalChallenge`)
- **Input**: Syllabus analysis and text
- **Process**: Generate thought-provoking question in Ukrainian
- **Context**: Student profiles (IT, Finance, Military, Management)
- **Output**: Single open-ended question

#### Respond to Challenge (`respondToChallenge`)
- **Input**: Instructor response to challenge question
- **Context**: Full discussion history
- **Process**: 
  1. Generate constructive Ukrainian feedback
  2. Provide 2-3 concrete suggestions
  3. Include Ukrainian examples where possible
  4. Ask follow-up question
  5. Extract actionable recommendations
- **Output**: AI response + additional recommendations added to syllabus

### 4. Ukrainian Cases Search (`searchUkrainianCases`)

**Method**: 
- Uses OpenAI's web_search_preview tool
- Cannot use JSON mode (tool limitation)
- Manual JSON extraction from response

**Process**:
1. Search for 3-5 relevant cases
2. Filter by student clusters
3. Focus on Ukrainian companies
4. Extract: title, cluster, description, learning points, source, relevance score

**Integration**: 
- Merged with main analysis recommendations
- Stored in studentClusterAnalysis.suggestedCases

## Material Quality and Correctness
